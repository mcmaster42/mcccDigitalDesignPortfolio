                <div class="inspiration-text">
                    <p>Gary Larson's "The Far Side" has been a massive influence on my artistic style and sense of humor. First published in 1979, Larson's single-panel comics combined absurdist humor with animals, humans, and science in unexpected ways.</p>
                    <p>What I admire most about Larson's work is how he uses simple drawings to convey complex jokes, often playing with perspective and the unexpected. His anthropomorphic animals, clueless humans, and bizarre scenarios taught me that humor can be found by simply viewing the ordinary world from a slightly different angle.</p>
